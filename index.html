        <p>Square Enix announced  <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/shadowbringers" target="_blank">Shadowbringers</a>, the next Final Fantasy XIV expansion, during last weekend’s Las Vegas Fan Festival 2018.
                Shadowbringers is due to be released in early Summer 2019 and will take players on new adventures while they become ‘Warriors of Darkness’. More information about the expansion will be shared by the developers at the Paris Fan Festival event (February 2nd-3rd, 2019) and then at the Tokyo Fan Festival (March 23rd-24th, 2019).
        </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The new expansion will bring an abundance of new content, including a new player race, multiple new jobs, an increased level cap up, sprawling new areas, adjustments to the battle system, as well as a variety of new battle, crafter and gatherer content. In addition to these core features, a number of new systems will be introduced with Shadowbringers.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>“Trust” System – </strong> Players will now be able to fight alongside familiar NPCs.</li>
            <li><strong>New Game+ Feature –</strong>A feature that allows players to “replay” the FINAL FANTASY XIVmain scenario stories.</li>
            <li><strong>World Visit System –</strong>Players will be able to travel to other servers on the same data center and interact with more players than ever before.</li>
        </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Check out the teaser trailer below. Shadowbringers will land on PC and PlayStation 4, though the developers have kept saying for a long time that they may bring Final Fantasy XIV to Xbox One and Nintendo Switch if crossplay between all platforms turned out to be possible.

        Now that Sony is finally opening up with the Fortnite beta program, there could be a chance for Final Fantasy XIV as well. We’ll see.
